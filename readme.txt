== Description ==

Description - Stop worrying about losing customers and trying to send them emails for abandoned carts. Instead, try 11za's new WooCommerce Plugin. It sends WhatsApp messages for abandoned cart recoveries and transaction alerts. WhatsApp messages have a high open rate, so more people will see them.

You might not know why carts are getting abandoned, even after sending many emails. But with WhatsApp messages, you can reach customers more effectively. Plus, installing the plugin is easy. You don't need to know how to code, and it's free.

So, stop struggling with low email open rates. 

Switch to 11za's WooCommerce Plugin and start using WhatsApp for better results.


=== How does it actually Works? ===

The WooCommerce plugin works like this: It grabs the phone number entered during checkout and saves the current cart. Then, 
it utilizes that phone number to send personalized WhatsApp message templates when needed. 
These messages include a link for easy access.

Some of the really Useful features are:

- Personalized Messages: Create special messages for each customer, using their name and a direct link to their cart, plus any other details you want to include.
- Shipping Notifications: Keep customers informed beyond just saving abandoned carts. Send updates about shipping, confirmations for orders, and more.
- Analytics Insights: Get clear stats with 11za. See how many people read and received your messages, so you can make your communication even better.
- Ready-to-Use Templates: Pick from a bunch of ready-made message templates. It's easy to find the perfect one for your needs.
- Scheduled Delivery: Decide when your messages go out. For example, you can set them to 1 Hour after someone leaves the checkout page.
